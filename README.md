In this example, the ReactiveFormsModule is imported in the AppModule, which makes it available to all components declared in the module. The FormBuilder, FormGroup, and Validators services are imported in the AppComponent file. The FormBuilder service is used to create the form and its controls, and the Validators service is used to specify validation rules for the form controls. The form is created in the ngOnInit lifecycle hook and is bound to the template using the [formGroup] directive. The form controls are created using the formControlName directive, and validation rules are specified using the Validators service. The Submit button is disabled if the form is invalid.

A FormGroup is a collection of FormControl instances that are grouped together to represent a complex form. The FormGroup has a value property that holds the values of all the form controls in the group,

FormBuilder is a utility class that helps you create instances of FormControl and FormGroup in a concise and readable way. Instead of manually creating instances of FormControl and FormGroup and setting their properties, you can use the methods provided by the FormBuilder to create the form. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

The FormBuilder class is a convenient way to create forms, especially when you need to create complex forms with multiple controls. However, you can also create forms manually using the FormControl and FormGroup classes, which gives you more control and flexibility over the form creation process.

The bind method is used to bind the this context and the min and max parameters to the validateAge function so that they are available when the function is called. The custom validator is then called for each value change of the control and returns an error object { invalidAge: true } if the value is outside the allowed range, or null if the value is valid.

The error message for the invalid age is displayed using the *ngIf directive and the form.get('age').errors?.invalidAge expression. The expression checks if the errors property of the age control is not null and if it contains an invalidAge property. If the condition is true, the error message is displayed.

The setValue method is used to set the entire value of a FormGroup or a FormControl. It requires an object that matches the structure of the form, with keys that match the names of the controls and values that represent the values of the controls.

The patchValue method is used to set only a subset of the values in a FormGroup or a FormControl. It also requires an object with keys that match the names of the controls and values that represent the values of the controls.

It's worth noting that you can also use the setValue and patchValue methods when working with nested forms, such as a FormArray or a FormGroup within another FormGroup. In these cases, you can use the methods on the nested FormGroup or FormArray instance, and the values will be set accordingly.
