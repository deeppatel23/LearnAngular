FormControl represents a single form control element, such as an input field or a checkbox. It has a value property that holds the current value of the form control, and a set of validation rules that are used to validate the value of the control.

In this example, the ReactiveFormsModule is imported in the AppModule, which makes it available to all components declared in the module.

The form controls are created using the formControlName directive, and validation rules are specified using the Validators service. The Submit button is disabled if the form is invalid.
